How to use
---------------
1) Copy script into your folder and rename ivonatts.py

2) Generate IVONA keys from the IVONA Cloud website

3) Open another script and write the following

      include ivonatts as voice
      voice.start( Your Access Key , Your Secret Key , Voice Name , Sentence Break (Integer), Paragraph Break (Integer), Speech Speed)
      voice.TextToSpeech( String To Speak )

4) Run It


This is a recreation of the unsupported PYVONA
I have simplified the code however main functions remain similar.
